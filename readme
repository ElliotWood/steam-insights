## 📋 Recommended Architecture Plan

### **Tech Stack Components:**

1. **Database Layer**
   - PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured game data
   - Time-series optimized storage for player counts/trends
   - Consider data warehouse (BigQuery, Redshift) for historical analytics

2. **Data Scraping/ETL Tool**
   - Python-based scraper using:
     - Steam Web API integration
     - BeautifulSoup for web scraping
     - Pandas for data transformation
     - APScheduler or Airflow for scheduled updates

3. **Dashboard Frontend**
   - Options:
     - **Streamlit** (fastest to prototype)
     - **Dash by Plotly** (Python-based, highly customizable)
     - **React + D3.js/Recharts** (most flexible, professional)
     - **Tableau/Power BI** (if prefer BI tools)

4. **Backend API** (Optional but recommended)
   - FastAPI or Flask for REST API
   - Enables separation of data layer and frontend
